# rover-controller

FTI team, please take a look. I had fun with it, so thanks for the opportunity either way.

There is almost certainly a more elegant way to structure everything, but I sort of ran out of time.

Also, I prefer to use gitlab, so if you want to see the commits, or anything
else I have there (there's really just one thing) please check that out: https://gitlab.com/rherbison/rover-controller
